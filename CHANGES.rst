-   Modernize ``jinja`` theme. Local extensions used by Jinja are not
    available yet.

    themes are available when ``"pallets_sphinx_themes"`` is added to
    ``extensions``.
-   Only run event callbacks added by theme when the theme is actually
    in use. This allows the package to be installed without interfering
    with other themes.

    Read the Docs.

    ``.. rst-class:: hide-header``. The header is still useable by

    large logo image.
-   Disable the sidebar logo on the index page with
    ``html_theme_options["index_sidebar_logo"] = False``.

    ``versions.html`` sidebar. When viewing an old version, or the
    development version, a warning is displayed at the top of each page.

    ``html_context["project_links"]`` will be rendered in the
    ``project.html`` sidebar.
