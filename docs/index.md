The Documentation for the Pallets Sphinx Themes.

The Pallets Sphinx Themes are a series of themes that are used across the pallets projects documentation. The themes would then later inspire other Sphinx themes such as [Kenneth Reitz’s](https://kennethreitz.org) [“krTheme” Sphinx theme](https://github.com/kennethreitz/kr-sphinx-themes) (it’s the one used in his Requests project), and objectively the most popular one, the [Alabaster](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) theme.

This package ships 4 Sphinx themes for usage:
- Flask
- Jinja
- Click
- Werkzeug

If you are writing an extension for a project, be sure to use the appropriate theme to make your documentation look consistent. For example, if you are writing a Flask extension, use the Flask theme.
